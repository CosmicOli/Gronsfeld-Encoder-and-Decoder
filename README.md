# Gronsfeld-Encoder-and-Decoder
A tkinter and console based python script that allows plaintext or cyphertext to be encoded or decoded using a given gronsfeld cypher key.

This was made several years prior and has been uploaded for safekeeping for future personal use.
Hence, this code only prints the output in the console and not in the tkinter window.
